  # Core rule 4. Do not share current round information in public places, or abuse current round information.
  
  While sharing current round information is okay between peers, it should be avoided in any public capacity. While you can most likely trust your peers to act in good faith, the same can't be said for any other wondering eyes that may be watching.
  
  What you are aware of does not equal what your character is aware of. If you have gained any knowledge about the current round that your character explicitly has not gained themselves via comms or witnessing, you cannot act on it, or attempt to "accidentally" strole upon said information. If you are caught abusing current round information, you will be punished.
  
  Any information about the round is okay to be posted publicly once the round end screen shows after EVAC docks.
