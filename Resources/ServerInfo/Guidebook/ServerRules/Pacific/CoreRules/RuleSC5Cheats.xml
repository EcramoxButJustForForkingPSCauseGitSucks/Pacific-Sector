  # Core rule 5. Do not use any cheats or exploits to gain an unfair advantage.
  
  Usage of any tools that give you an unfair advantage against other players is strictly prohibited. This includes macros, memory scanning software (IE Cheat engine), or exploitation of anything that is clearly unintended behaviour in the game such as glitches or lag based advantages. This is STRICTLY enforced.
  
  There are expeptions to the rule when it comes to "unintended behaviour." If the glitch being used is not harmful in nature, and is not being used in a way that diminishes other peoples experience, then it's fair game. Using glitches to enrichen the round is okay, but be aware that the bug will be fixed, though you will not be punished for usage unless used maliciously.
