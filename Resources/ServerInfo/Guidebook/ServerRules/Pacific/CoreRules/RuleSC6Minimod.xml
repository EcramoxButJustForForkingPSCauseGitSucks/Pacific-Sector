  # Core rule 6. Avoid minimodding where it can be helped.
  
  Minimodding is attempting to moderate over players when you don't have the authority to do so. While encouraging good behaviour and reminding people of the rules is okay, approaching a player and threatening them with admin intervention while quoting rules in an antagonistic manor is not. If a player is breaking the rules, do not make it your own mission. Rather, ahelp it with as much information as you can give.
