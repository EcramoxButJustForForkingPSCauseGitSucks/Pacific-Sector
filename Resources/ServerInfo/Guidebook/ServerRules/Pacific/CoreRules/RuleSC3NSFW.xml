  # Core rule 3. Do not participate in, or facilitate any content that may be distressing to others.

  We want to foster a welcoming environment for everyone, and while for some more explicit types of content is normalized, it's important to be aware that others may not be so comfortable with it.

  # Sexual content
  ERP of any kind is a big no-no. Any infractions on this will be taken very seriously. This applies even if it is just you, and another person hidden away from the rest of the station. People spectate, and they have to see this. This also includes any flirtatious hints to out of station RP of which can very easily be told the context of.

  Sexual jokes and comments in moderation is okay, provided it isn't too intense, and depends on context. Someone telling you to "suck their dick" is fine. trying to make another character uncomfortable by being overly flirtatious and explicit, is not.

  # Shock content
  The nature of the game brings some pretty graphic scenes, but there's a limit in terms of interpretation. Being overly descriptive of a persons wounds or a scene in a way that's meant to distress others should be used in moderation. Sometimes descriptions can enrich the RP, other times it can be just flat out disgusting. Use common sense.

  Real-life gore or shock content, or shock content created with the express purpose of disturbing people, is STRICTLY prohibited. This includes, but not limited to;
  - pornography
  - Distressing pictures of real life injuries
  - Animations made to distress others
  - Any type of fetish content
