  # Core rule 2 - Treat others with respect, don't be selfish.

  Remember that you are playing with other people. While your own enjoyment in game is important, so is everyone elses. Don't purposefully try to degrade other peoples experience for your own gain. Everyone deserves respect. In any case where you feel like you're being targeted by someone that may be infringing on this rule, ask them to stop in LOOC first, as there can sometimes be misunderstandings! If it continues however, request an admin via the ahelp window. (F1)
  
  Don't take advantage of any players that are SSD (afk). In the case that you're an antagonist and said player is your target, come back later, or ask an admin via ahelp for advice on what to do.
