  #Core rule 7. Take the games environment seriously, and try to stay in universe.
  
  This is a role playing game at it's heart, so maintaining the universe that the game creates is important. Make sure that you act in character at all times, and that your character acts as an individual, and not an extension of yourself. 
  
  Try to maintain your character based on the universe that you are playing in. A character making constant references to everyday life in real life doesn't make sense. If you wish to reference pop culture or real life happenings, spin it like a historical fact, or culteral history. We are far far in the future, our real lives today were far, far in the past, Before your character was even born.
  
  Being a joke character or a character that's overtly gimmicky is fine, but don't push it. If you wish to be goofy to an extreme degree, we have a clown job for that express purpose.
