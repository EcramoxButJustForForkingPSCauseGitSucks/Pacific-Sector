 # Core Rule 1 - Admins are to be held to the same standards as the rest of the community.
  
 While it is hoped for and encouraged for admins to have the best intentions, it is not always the case that admins are correct. If you feel at all threatened or wronged in an active situation, you have the right to ask for a mediator in the form of another admin. If you believe an admin has wrongly punished you, or has acted in poor faith, please report it to another admin.
  
 Admins have their own set of rules that they must follow. If they're found to be violating said rules, they can be reported anonymously to another admin so that action can be taken. Note that other admins will also remain vigilant in maintaining the admin rules also, so action will be taken if another admin finds their colleague is infringing on their own admin rules, so action will sometimes be taken without the communities awareness.
