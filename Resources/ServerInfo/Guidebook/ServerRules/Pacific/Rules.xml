# Server Rules

Pacific is an MRP server meaning the general rules for MRP apply, though our stance on how MRP is played is unique in comparison to the base game, so it is worth reviewing the rules to ensure that you understand our server culture. Some leeway is given to newer players for more minor infractions as a result, so don't panic if you're contacted!

## Core Rules
These rules apply at all times, including between rounds. These also apply to our Discord server or any other enviroments under Pacific.
