  # Server Rules


  Pacific is an MRP server meaning the general rules for MRP apply, though our stance on how MRP is played is unique in comparison to the base game, so it is worth reviewing the rules to ensure that you understand our server culture. Some leeway is given to newer players for more minor infractions as a result, so don't panic if you're contacted!


  ## Core Rules
  These rules apply at all times, including between rounds. These also apply to our Discord server or any other environments under Pacific.

  - [textlink="1. Admins are to be held to the same standards as the rest of the community." link="RuleSC1"]
  - [textlink="2. Treat others with respect, don't be selfish." link="RuleSC2"]
  - [textlink="3. Do not participate in, or facilitate any content that may be distressing to others." link="RuleSC3"]
  - [textlink="4. Do not abuse current round information." link="RuleSC4"]
  - [textlink="5. Do not use any cheats or exploits to gain an unfair advantage." link="RuleSC5"]
  - [textlink="6. Avoid minimodding where it can be helped." link="RuleSC6"]
  - [textlink="7. Respect yours, and others' privacy." link="RuleSC7"]
  - [textlink="8. Don’t be intolerant." link="RuleSC8"]

  If you require any further elaboration on our core rules, please don't be afraid to ahelp, or ask in the Discord.
