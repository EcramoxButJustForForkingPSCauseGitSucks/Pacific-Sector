  # RP rule 2. Make a believable character.


  While this is a remote sector and some odd sorts are to be expected, don't play an obvious reference or over-the-top gimmick character. Being a joke character or a character that's overtly gimmicky is fine, but don't push it. If you wish to be goofy to an extreme degree, we have a clown job for that express purpose.
