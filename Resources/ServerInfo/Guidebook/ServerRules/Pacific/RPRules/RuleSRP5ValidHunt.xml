  # RP rule 5. Don’t valid hunt.


  Valid hunting is when you go around looking for people being antagonistic to go and kill them. Don't do this, it ruins the game for security and especially the antag you find out.

  What IS valid hunting:
  - Examining every person you pass by to see if they’re holding an emag.
  - Immediately  bashing someone’s skull in when they use their flash on someone and calling them a revolutionary.
  - Arming yourself with improvised weapons when there are no confirmed threats.
  What is NOT valid hunting:
  - Attacking someone who is trying to kill you or a friend/colleague.
  - Keeping a toolbox close by after a traitor has murdered someone.

  While security is given more leeway with valid hunting rules they aren't exempt from them. In general if an act can be interpreted in multiple ways, the most damning interpretation should be the last option.
