  # RP rule 3. Follow reasonable escalation.


  Imagine how a real person would handle the situation. Imagine someone in real life murdering a person because theyâ€™re loitering somewhere they shouldn't. The more likely situation is they get told to leave, and if they dont a fist fight may ensue, or security is called. In general follow the below series of events:
  Verbal argument > unarmed fighting > non-lethal weapons > lethal weapons.


  Security can skip over certain steps depending on the alert level and specific situation. See RP rule 4.
