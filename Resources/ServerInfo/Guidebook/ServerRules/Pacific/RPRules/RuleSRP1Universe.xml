  # RP rule 1. Take the game's environment seriously.


  This is a role playing game at its heart, so maintaining the universe that the game creates is important. Make sure that you act in character at all times, and that your character acts as an individual, and not an extension of yourself.


  Try to maintain your character based on the universe that you are playing in. A character making constant references to everyday life in real life doesn't make sense. If you wish to reference pop culture or real life happenings, spin it like a historical fact, or culteral history. We are far far in the future, our real lives today were far, far in the past, Before your character was even born.
