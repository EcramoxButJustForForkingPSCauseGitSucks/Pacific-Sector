  # RP rule 4. Respect the alert level.


  Follow the procedure that your department has for whatever alert level you’re currently on. While this isn’t strictly necessary, it makes the match flow much better, and makes it a more enjoyable experience for both SEC and antags.


  While disobeying alert level procedure is fine, keep in mind that SEC will reserve the right to use reasonable escalation to get you to obey procedure.
